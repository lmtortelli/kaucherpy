_package_description = """Interval Arithmetic package

This package provides types and functions for Maximum Accuracy Interval
Arithmetic.

The Interval Arithmetic is a mathematical tool for the solution of problems
related to numerical errors, based on an algebraic system formed by all closed
intervals of Real Line (or rectangles of Complex Plane) and operations defined
on it. Rather than usual numerical algorithms, it's used interval algorithms
producing intervals containing the correct answer as a result.

The Maximum Accuracy, on the other hand, provides an axiomatic method for
arithmetic operations performed in computers that capture essential properties
associated with rounding.

For more information about it, see:

[1] Moore, R. E., Interval Analysis. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New
    Jersey, 1966.
[2] Moore, R. E., Methods and Applications of Interval Analysis. SIAM Studies
    in Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia, 1979.
[3] Kulisch, U. W., Miranker, W. L., Computer Arithmetic in Theory and
    Practice. Academic Press, 1981.

Currently only Real Intervals are available. No Complex Intervals, no Interval
Vectors and Matrixes, and no extensions of basic functions. These will be our
next work.

It was developed in CIn/UFPE (Brazil) by Rafael Menezes Barreto
<rmb3@cin.ufpe.br, rafaelbarreto87@gmail.com> and it's free software.
